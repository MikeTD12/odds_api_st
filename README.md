This repository serves as a web application that displays gambling odds/point spreads from "the odds api" https://the-odds-api.com/
The code will not work unless you obtain your own api key from the odds api. Each "get" python file imports the api_key.

The web framework comes courtesy of streamlit.io. Streamlit is a great framework to display and share data. It is a very light weight framework for simple applications.
